# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
<!-- I'm GIS and Digital Twin Specialist. <br> -->
I specialize in processing and analyzing geospatial data (both 2D🗺️ and 3D data🌎).<br>

I also deal with the interactive visualization of highly-detailed 3D geospatial datasets (e.g. photogrammetry mesh models) using game engine technology 🎮.<br>

What's more, I have experience creating 3D models using procedural modeling techniques. In general, I care very much for process automation - hence my love❤️ for photogrammetry📷 and procedural modeling.
