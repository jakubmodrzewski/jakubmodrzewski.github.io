description: In addition to creating a 3D reconstruction of the city layout of Nea Paphos, my work explored the potential of using procedural modeling in Esri CityEngine and Unreal Engine to create "physical" 3D models suitable for subsequent simulations (e.g., building destruction). Incorporating physical aspects into 3D modeling, such as avoiding self-intersections in geometry and maintaining proper wall thickness, has a significant impact on the outcomes of simulations using physics-based systems.
