description:  |
        I have examined the capabilities of Unreal Engine 5, including Nanite, for effective rendering large-scale 3D city model that was obtained using photogrammetric techniques. The key thing was also integration of two types of 3D models: mentioned mesh model and semantic city model generated procedurally based on two-dimensional spatial data, and finally taking advantage of both of them.

<!-- # The Movies Project

The Movies Project is something like **Netflix**, the only difference is that **it's not real**! It doesn't exist! I just created it to demonstrate how the **showcase** page looks like and how you can write whatever you want with full markdown support.
